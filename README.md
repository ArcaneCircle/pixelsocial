# PixelSocial

A small micro-blogging social network app with PixelArt aesthetics
and integrated filter to pixelate shared images.

Thanks to the [webxdc](https://webxdc.org) technology, it means
there is no login or registration needed, nor dependency on any
server, and you can have your very own independent instance of the
social network in a group chat with friends and family, your data
staying in your devices and e2e encrypted if you use it inside
Delta Chat.

It can also be wired with bots that allow importing RSS feeds
inside the network (including RSS feeds of Mastodon accounts!)
for example see: https://github.com/deltachat-bot/pixelsocial
